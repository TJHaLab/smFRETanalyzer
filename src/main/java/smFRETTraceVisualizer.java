/*
 * This class lets a single spot's time trace be inspected alongside the images it was measured
 * from.
 *
 * Like smFRETTraceHistogram it is interactive rather than batch and writes nothing. It differs
 * in using two windows: the field the spots were found in, which is where a spot is picked, and
 * a second window holding everything that follows from that pick - the traces above, and the
 * donor and acceptor channels zoomed in on the spot side by side below. The frame the two
 * images show is chosen with a slider, so they can be walked through while the traces stay in
 * view and a cursor tracks the position along them.
 *
 * Its input is the spot finder JSON, which names everything else - the image, the mapping, the
 * spot table - and whose own path gives the root name the trace H5 was written under.
