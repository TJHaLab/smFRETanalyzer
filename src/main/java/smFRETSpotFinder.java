/**
 * Interactive, so the parameter dialog stays open between runs.
 *
 * Spot finding is a thing you tune rather than a thing you do once - the threshold, the tolerance
 * and the prominence all have to be looked at against the image before they are right - and with a
 * plain Command that meant going back to the Plugins menu for every adjustment. Implementing
 * Interactive gets a non-modal dialog out of the same @Parameter declarations, so nothing about
 * the widgets, the labels or the min validation changes; only its lifetime does. The findSpots
 * button is what actually runs an analysis, because the alternative - running on every keystroke -
 * would re-analyse and rewrite four output files while a number is being typed. Opening the
 * dialog does nothing either - see run() for how that is kept out of the way of the macros.

     * Estimate background of an image.
     *
     * The background is a Gaussian weighted mean of the pixels we trust - inside the overlap
     * region and away from a spot - with the rest filled in by the same weighting. Then the
     * pixels sitting more than backgroundKappa robust standard deviations *above* that estimate
     * are dropped and it is computed again, a few times over.
     *
     * That second part is the point. Telling the estimator where the spots are is not enough,
     * because a real PSF has wings that reach well past any masking radius a crowded field can
     * afford, and the light in them lands in the pixels the estimator was told to trust. It
     * then reads the background high exactly where the background is about to be subtracted,
     * so it is subtracted twice. Letting the estimator find the contaminated pixels for itself
     * is what fixes that, and it makes the masking radius matter much less.
     *
     * The clipping is deliberately one-sided. Contamination only ever makes a pixel brighter,
     * so rejecting symmetrically would throw away good dark pixels and pull the estimate down.
     *
     * One-sidedness has a price, and it is paid back explicitly - see truncationConstants. Keeping
     * only the pixels below kappa spread leaves a truncated sample whose mean sits below the true
     * background, so the estimate reads low even where there is nothing to clip but noise. Measured
     * at about 1 ADU, roughly 2.8 times the single-round prediction because four rounds compound it.
     * That matters out of all proportion to its size: a trace is 4*pi*sigma^2 times frame minus
     * background, so 1 ADU is 50 units of trace, and spotFilterSNR scales the same error by its own
     * 2*pi*sigma^2 while the signal it is compared against grows only as sigma. The result was
     * an SNR that climbed with spot size - +15% from sigma 1 to 3 at fixed true significance, and
     * +46% at fixed molecular brightness - so spotThreshold silently meant something different on
     * every movie. Correcting the level each round rather than once at the end is what keeps the
     * clip in the right place and stops the bias compounding; it takes the drift to 0.5%.
     *
     * The estimate is returned as float whatever the input was. It used to be rounded back into
     * the input's type, which on an 8 bit movie meant the background was quantized to whole ADU -
     * and since a trace is 4*pi*sigma^2 times the difference between the frame and the background,
     * one ADU there is 50 units of trace. That quantization was carrying about 0.3 ADU of rounding
     * noise into every measurement, and it made any small disagreement in the estimate land as a
     * full step rather than a small one.
     *
     * Neither the clipping threshold nor the smoothing scale is asked for. The threshold comes
     * from spotSigma - see clippingThreshold - and the smoothing is a constant. Both were swept
     * against a known background over simulated PSFs from sigma 1 to 3, and what came out is
     * that only one of the three settings genuinely follows the spot size:
     *
     *   - the masking radius hardly matters. Anything from 2 to 6 pixels costs at most 11% more
     *     error at any sigma, and 4 is within 2% everywhere. That is this estimator working as
     *     intended: once the clip finds the contaminated pixels itself, there is little left for
     *     the mask to do. That held while the clip was biased; with the bias corrected the
     *     mask matters again at large spot sizes, which is why spotMargin follows spotSigma;
     *   - the threshold is sharp, and one grid step away costs 15 to 40%. It is worth deriving;
     *   - the smoothing scale showed no trend against sigma at all. It is set by how fast the
     *     illumination varies, not by the spots.

     * per tap-pixel from sigma 7 to sigma 28. Decimating by d cuts both factors: d squared fewer

     * 0.26 ms at d of 4.
     *
     * The blur is not the whole cost, which is why d of 4 is the knee rather than a waypoint.
     * Binning and interpolating back are both full resolution passes and do not shrink with d, so
     * by d of 4 the three phases cost about the same and the total has fallen 3.34 ms to 0.75 ms -
     * a factor of 4.5, not 64. Past that there is little of the blur left to remove.
     *
     * It is an approximation, but a mild and quantifiable one. Summing d by d blocks is a box
     * prefilter, which adds d squared over twelve to the variance of the effective kernel - 1.3
     * square pixels at d of 4 against sigma 14's 196, so the kernel this actually applies is
     * sigma 14.05. The estimate is a surface that varies on a 14 pixel scale being sampled every
     * d pixels, which is far above what it needs. See backgroundDecimation for what that ratio
     * costs if sigma is lowered without lowering d.
     *
     * Both the weighted sum and the weight are summed rather than averaged, and each is
     * decimated the same way, so the d squared factors cancel when the caller divides one by

     * at every spot size, and the old default of 1.8 sat *above* the sigma 1 ideal: at
     * spotSigma 1.0 it rejected every real spot. Hence a thin annulus at 2 sigma and the
     * explicit normalization.

     * foreground was tried and is worse (0.776) - smoothing blurs the neighbour into the spot,
     * which is the thing being looked for.
     *
     * The old max(1, ...) on each ring pixel was an absolute ADU floor, and it is what made the
     * filter select against bright spots on real data: a dim spot's ring is noise near zero,
     * clamped to 1, scoring a huge ratio, where a bright spot's ring is real PSF wings scoring
     * their true ratio. On hel1 that rejected 52% of spots at SNR 15-25 against 16% below 10.
