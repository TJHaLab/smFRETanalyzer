/*
 * Type checks for the files the user chooses in the parameter dialogs.
 *
 * The checks live here rather than in the widget because the widget cannot do them. SciJava's
 * file style does support "extensions:tif/tiff", but SwingFileWidget applies that filter only in
 * its drag and drop handler - the Browse button calls UIService.chooseFile with the style
 * collapsed back to a bare "open", and there is no single file chooseFile overload that takes a
 * filter. A path typed into the text field or passed by a macro bypasses the widget entirely in
 * any case, and the batch macros are how this pipeline is normally driven.
 *
 * The point of all of it is the message. Two of the four file kinds here are JSON written by
 * this pipeline, and from the outside they are indistinguishable - both sit beside the movie with
 * a '.json' extension. Handing the spot finder's own output back to it as a mapping used to parse
 * cleanly and then fail several steps later as "Cannot transform image, transform model not set",
 * which names neither the file nor the mistake. So every check here reports what the file
 * actually is as well as what was wanted.
