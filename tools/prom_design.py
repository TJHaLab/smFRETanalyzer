"""
Settle the prominence definition and its threshold. This is what produced the current filter.

Every candidate is normalized by its own noiseless ideal - the same ring statistic applied to a
unit height Gaussian of that sigma over the same pixel offsets - so a perfect isolated spot
scores 1.0 at every spot size and the threshold reads as a fraction of ideal.

Candidates:
  thick/max   the shipped ring before this, (srad-1)^2 <= r^2 <= (srad+1)^2 summarised by its
              brightest pixel
  thin /max   a thin annulus at 2 sigma, still the brightest pixel
  thin /p90   the annulus summarised by its 90th percentile   <- what won
  *  smoothed  the same on the smoothed foreground rather than the raw one

Run gen_shape.py at constant SNR first - `N` proportional to sigma - or the large sigma fields
sit at the detection limit and the comparison is meaningless.
